# Fan-Controllers
## Asustor AS6212RD

A script which will monitor disk(s) temp. It monitor the hottest disk in order to change the fan speed

## DELL R320

A VERY basic script to control the fan speed based on CPU Temp and fully customizable via JSON file
> It should work on any DELL server, but it was tested on R320 model.
thanks to @diferentec for the original script used as base for this one.

### Change Log:
    v1.3.1  2020-10-29
            Odd Values Management
            *   Fixing odd values when the environment temp is very low 
                and when "jumping" down, the calculated speed gets values below 0x00
    v1.3    2020-10-28
            Fine Tuning without stoping the script:
            *   Now the following variables can be modified when the script is running, 
                at the end of every loop it wil be reloaded
            *   When a variable is modified, the log will be populated with the change
            *   The modificable variables are: 
                Interval, Max_CPU_Temp, Target_Temp, Hist, Steps, Jump, JumpTemp
            Improved fan control
            *   A new couple of variables are included:
                when the diference between actual temp and "Target_Temp" is bigger (above or below)
                than "JumpTemp" value, then, the fan speed will "Jump" the speed this number of hex steps,
                so "Target_Temp" will be reached faster.
